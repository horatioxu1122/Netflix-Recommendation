# Netflix-Recommendation
Netflix is an over-the-top content platform and production company. Its primary business is a subscription-based streaming service offering online streaming from a library of films and television series, including those produced in-house. <br/>
The dateset consists of tv shows and movies available on Netflix as 2019. The dataset is collected from Flixable which is a third-party Netflix search engine. The dataset also includes vital IMDB movies and rating information, but the movie dataset file is too large so I won't be able to upload it on Github. <br/>
## TV vs. Movies

This shows that Netflix focuses on Movies a lot more than on TVs. <br/>
## Movies rating analysis

It is not hard to conclude that Netflix invests lot of money on TV-MA and TV-14 ratings movies. TV-MA means that the content is for mature audience only and TV-14 means that adult guardians may find the content unsuitable for children under the age of 14. R rated movies come in third place. It is quite logical because children under the age of 14 doesn't necessarily have the economic independence of buying Netflix subscription. <br/>
## Year analysis

Interesting to see that 2017 was the year that most of movies were released. That deserves a more in-depth research. <br/>
## Duration analysis

It clearly shows that a considerable amount of movies have the duration of around 100 minutes. Movie makers want to make sure that the audiences are able to sit through the whole movie, not leaving at the middle of a scene. Not every movie is like "Avengers: Endgame" that is full of story-telling. <br/>
## Country analysis

The U.S. is the most content making country in the world. Netflix is a American company. So naturally, the U.S. wins this contest.

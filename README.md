# Netflix-Recommendation
Netflix is an over-the-top content platform and production company. Its primary business is a subscription-based streaming service offering online streaming from a library of films and television series, including those produced in-house. 
The dateset consists of tv shows and movies available on Netflix as 2019. The dataset is collected from Flixable which is a third-party Netflix search engine. The dataset also includes vital IMDB movies and rating information, but the movie dataset file is too large so I won't be able to upload it on Github.
